# SauceDemoTests
techassesment

Steps to run -
1. Go to src/main/java and open the class - Utilmethods. Edit the System.properties to add a path (The current path for 
chroempath in my machine) to the chromedriver or you can comment it out if the path for the chromedriver is already declared
in your environment.
2. After the changing the above file, go to src/test/java and right click and select 'run as junit' the file - 'SauceDemotests.java'

Thats it. Hopefully it will run cleanly. I just tested it out myself. I had coded from home, just cloned the tests to my office
machine now and it seems working here. Please let me know if not.
